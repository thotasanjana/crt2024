In this program we will calculate the power of a number using C programming. We want to calculate the power of any given number so you need to multiply that particular number power of time. Ex:- Let suppose number is 24 so we need to multiply with 4 times of 2. That is 2*2*2*2=16. Number is 53 so we need to multiply with 3 time of 5. That is 5*5*5=125
